I am a software developer at `Adobe` India. I am backend engineer for Creative Cloud Desktop. 
I also ideate and tinker in the space of Computer Vision & Generative AI in my spare time. You can go through the some of the projects I pursued at Adobe. I am also pursuing a Masters (online) in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology. 

Previously, I graduated from IIT Kanpur with a major in Electrical Engineering and minors in Machine Learning & Cognitive Sciences. There I worked with K.S. Venkatesh on developing forced/3D touch for generic capacitive screens. 

Also, I sometimes watch movies, and may be listen to a lot of music.
